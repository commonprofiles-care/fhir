### This file describes how to make a realse of the FHIR profiles and value sets. The release process is based on the auto-ig-builder

1. Create an issue asking for a release, this should be approved by at least 2 organization members.
2. When its been aprove create a tag in the format `vX.Y.Z` where X.Y.Z is the version number. This tag should be created in the main branch.
3. Push the tag to the repository
4. Wait for the auto-ig-builder to pick up the tag and build the release. This can take some time.
