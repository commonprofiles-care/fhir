  "purpose": "To define a small lightweight Organization resource for the primary use case of being included as referenced/contained from other resources. This will allow applications to display the most fundamental organization information like name and business identifier together with other resources like a ServiceRequest or an Observation. When fetching such resources, the referenced Organization resource can be included using this profile.\r\nThe profile can be used for healthcare organizations, often identified using hsa id, but also non-healthcare organizations, often identified using organization id.",
