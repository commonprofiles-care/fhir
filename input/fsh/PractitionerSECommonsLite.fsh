Description: "This is a light weight Swedish Practitioner profile. 
                It can be used when practitioners have been referenced by other resources, such as Observation, ServiceRequest or Appointment, to fetch a minimal set of practitioner information. E.g. for display purposes. 
                It can also be used for presenting a simple list of practitioners with associated information."
