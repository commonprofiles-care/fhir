Description: "This is a light weight Swedish Practitioner profile. 
                It can be used when practitioners have been referenced by other resources, such as Observation, ServiceRequest or Appointment, to fetch a minimal set of practitioner information. E.g. for display purposes. 
                It can also be used for presenting a simple list of practitioners with associated information."
* ^purpose = "To use for simple use cases where practitioner data is needed. 
                Examples could be to populate a list of practitioners for selection in a UI or including a small practitioner resource in a Bundle togehter with another resource that is referencing it."
