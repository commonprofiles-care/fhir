## Introduction
This ImplementationGuide is published by a collaborative group of Swedish stakeholders of healthcare IT systems. It includes implementation profiles, extensions and value sets created by the group.
It also includes core profiles, value sets and extensions which have not been published by this group but are used in one way or another in the implementation profiles. One example is the [Swedish base profiles](http://hl7.se/fhir/ig/base/profiles.html) which have been derived to implementation profiles published in this ImplementationGuide.

### Published profiles:

## The collaborative group
The development, administration and publishing of the FHIR artifacts is carried out by a collaborative group with representation from
* Cambio
* Carasent
* Doctrin
* Chorus
* ImagineCare

We meet biweekly to work with ongoing tasks. For hands-on profiling activities we usually book separate focus meetings for those interested. The biweekly meetings also functions as a review session of the created FHIR artifacts.
