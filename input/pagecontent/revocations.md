# Introduction
This page explains how to interpret the structure of the [ConsentTemporaryRevocationSE](StructureDefinition-ConsentTemporaryRevocationSE.html) profile.

## Intended use
This profile defines how to represent a temporary revocation of an inner block ("tillfällig hävning av inre spärr" in Swedish), in accordance with Swedish Patient Data Act (SVOD). An inner block means that the patient has blocked access to their data belonging to a specific care unit from outside of that care unit. A temporary revocation of an inner block means that the inner block is temporarily lifted for a specific clinician or a care unit outside of the care unit where the block was set, but within the same care provider. In order to enforce a temporary revocation, patient consent is needed. A temporary revocation is, as the name implies, temporary and should only be active for a short period of time.
