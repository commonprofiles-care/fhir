# Introduction
This page explains how to interpret the structure of the [ConsentSharedElectronicHealthRecordSE](StructureDefinition-ConsentSharedElectronicHealthRecordSE.html) profile.

## Intended use
This profile defines how to represent a patient's consent to share their personal health record ("samtycke till att ingå i sammanhållen journalföring" in Swedish) with a clinician or a care unit, in accordance with Swedish Patient Data Act (SVOD). This consent allows the clinician or all clinicians at a care unit to access the patient's health record from another care provider than their own. Data from other care providers is illegal to access unless there is a consent, such as one defined in this profile, or the clinicians perceive there to be an immediate risk to the patient's life ("emergency").
