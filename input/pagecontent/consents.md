# Introduction
This page explains how to interpret the structure of the [ConsentSharedElectronicHealthRecordSe](StructureDefinition-ConsentSharedElectronicHealthRecordSe.html) profile.

## Intended use
This profile define how to represent a patient's consent to share their personal health record with a clinician or a care unit, in accordance with Swedish Patient Data Act. This consent allows the clinician or all clinicians at a care unit to access the patient's health record from another care provider than their own. Data from other care providers is illegal to access unless there is a consent, such as one defined in this profile, or the healthcare professional perceive there to be an immediate risk to the patient's life ("emergency").
